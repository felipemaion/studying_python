# Livewires Python Course #

Release 1.3


# INTRODUCTION #

This is the LiveWires Python Course, release 1.3. It consists of a
number of worksheets which are intended to help people who have not
programmed before to learn the Python language. The sheets were written
for use in an environment where there are knowledgeable programmers
around to answer questions, rather than for self-teaching, but it should
be possible to use them to teach yourself Python.

Overview of the course:
-----------------------

The course consists of a collection of worksheets. The Beginners' course
consists of 5 numbered worksheets (numbered Sheet 1 to Sheet 5), which
are intended to be worked through in numerical order, and a whole load
of lettered worksheets (lettered A to Z, with some gaps) which provide
background or go deeper into a particular topic.

As well as this, there are some games worksheets which are intended for
people who have been through the numbered sheets. Each sheet takes the
reader through the process of writing a simple graphical game (such as
Space War, or Pacman).

Sheet W contains an documentation on the LiveWires package. Sheet V
contains an overview of the course.

The games sheets are a lot newer than the beginners' sheets, so the
quality of them is probably more uneven. Let us know if you find
mistakes (see the Comments section below for how to tell us).

Modification and distribution of the course:
--------------------------------------------

The worksheets are distributed under the LiveWires Documentation
Licence, which is a BSD-like licence for documentation. You may not
distribute or modify the sheets unless you comply with the licence. You
can find the licence in the COPYING.txt file, which should have come
with this distribution, and also in the LaTeX source files themselves
(if you've downloaded an archive which includes the source of the
sheets).

What you will need:
-------------------

- You will need Python to use the course. Python can be obtained from:
  <http://www.python.org/download/> We recommend you download Python 2.1
  as it's the latest version of Python at the time of writing.

- You will need the Tk graphics libraries if you want to use the
  graphical parts of the worksheets. The Windows installer for Python
  comes with Tk, otherwise you'll need to install it yourself. See the
  documentation that comes with Python for details.

- You will need the Pygame libraries if you want to use the games
  worksheets. Pygame can be found at <http://www.pygame.org/>

- You will also need the LiveWires package, which is a set of Python
  modules we've provided to simplify your first steps with Python. You
  can obtain the package from <http://www.livewires.org.uk/python/>

Comments and corrections:
-------------------------

If you have comments on the course or you spot any typos, you can email
the maintainers at python@livewires.org.uk

Please don't email us with general Python programming queries as we
don't have time to answer them all. You could try posting a question to
the comp.lang.python newsgroup if you get stuck. Better yet, the
python-tutor email list exists to help people learn Python: you can
find details at <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor>

Note: we don't consider the use of British spellings (licence, colour,
grey and so on) to be typos. :-)
