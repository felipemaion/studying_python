CONDITIONS:

A "Transparent" form of a document means a machine-readable form,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
by readers is not Transparent. A form that is not Transparent is
called "Opaque". 

Examples of Transparent formats include LaTeX source and plain text.

a document are considered to be Opaque.
